# Agent Instructions (Codex / Vibecoding)

These guidelines apply to the entire repository.

## Workflow
- Read relevant files before editing; prefer small, well-scoped changes.
- Keep changes focused and explain intent in commit messages.
- Run the most relevant tests or checks when feasible; document if skipped.
- Avoid introducing unrelated refactors.

## Coding Practices
- Match existing style, naming, and formatting in nearby code.
- Prefer clear, readable code with straightforward control flow.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.
- Update docs only when user-requested or behavior changes require it.

## Communication
- Summarize changes and list tests run in the final response.
- Call out any follow-up work or risks.
